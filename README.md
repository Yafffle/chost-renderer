# chost-renderer
An HTML renderer for your archived cohost.org posts located in your data export folder in the form of json files.

# Compatibility
* Might not work in **Safari** browsers. Needs more testing.
* Is not intended for rendering CSS Crimes posts.

# How To Use
1. Unzip the downloaded **chost-renderer.zip** archive.
2. Find the **index.html** file in the root of the unzipped folder and open it with a browser of your choice.
3. Press the "Browse..." button at the top-left corner of the opened webpage.
4. Choose the **post.json** file you'd like to render. These files are located in your cohost export data folder â€” general file path should be **export_data/project/your_username/posts/published/your_post_permalink/post.json**.
5. That's it! Now there should be your post text under **Editor View** and **Rendered View**.
